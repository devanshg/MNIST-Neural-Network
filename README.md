# MNIST-Neural-Network
Simple Python neural network - Handwritten digits classification

This project is a simple Python application in which we implement and train a single layer neural network handwritten digit classifier using the MNIST database for both training and testing.

Two different datasets were used for training and testing:
* 10 records for the MNIST test dataset and 100 records from the MNIST training data set
* 10,000 records for the MNIST test dataset and 60,000 records from the MNIST training data set

The first dataset predicted with an accuracy of 60% and the second with dataset predicted with an accuracy of 97.7%
